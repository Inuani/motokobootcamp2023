1. Who controls the ledger canister ?

The NNS

2. What is the subnet of the canister with the id: mwrha-maaaa-aaaab-qabqq-cai? How much nodes are running this subnet?

3. I have a neuron with 1O ICPs locked with a dissolve delay of 4 years - my neuron has been locked for 2 years. What is my expected voting power?

1 ICP = 1 power of vote.
2 years dissolve -> 1,5x voting power
10 ICP locked for 2 years = 15 voting power

neuron locks for 2 years : 1.0625x
15Ã—1.0625 = 

15.937 voting power !!

4. What is wrong with the following code ?

It seems that the Nat module is missing.
the 2 variables are not used anywhere also.

5. What is wrong with the following code?

Array are of immutable type and can not create type [var Text], it can produce [Text].

6. What is wrong with the following code?

In this line :
languages := Array.append<Text>(languages, [new_language]);

the Array is not declared or initialised
